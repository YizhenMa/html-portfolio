<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I graduated from a university which is Shandong Jianzhu University in China. My major is Industal Design.</p>

<p>I'm thrilled to announce that this September marks the beginning of my academic journey at the esteemed

<p>Nature calls to me, and I love hiking in serene landscapes, soaking in the beauty around me. But that's not
  all—I also have a passion for dancing, as it allows me to express myself creatively and connect with others 
  through movement.In a nutshell, my life is a harmonious blend of reading, hitting the gym, dancing, and hiking—each 
  one contributing to my joy and fulfillment in unique ways.</p>
